# Key Points

## Network ID
Every Ethereum network has a network ID. We'll give our private network the network ID 3333. There's a community-run registry of Ethereum networks at https://chainid.network. Incidentally, main network's network ID is 1. 

## Consensus Algorithm
The main network uses proof-of-work consensus algorithm, but we'll go with proof-of-authority algorithm. It is much less resource-intensive than proof-of-work. Also, it avoids the 51% attack problem. 

## Genesis Block
Every blockchain starts with the first block - called the genesis block. Genesis block is created using a json file where we configure key parameters.
